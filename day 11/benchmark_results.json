        "response": "Tides on Earth are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun. The moon's gravity exerts a stronger influence because it is closer, creating bulges in Earth's oceans on the side facing and opposite the moon. As Earth rotates, these bulges move, resulting in the regular cycle of high and low tides.",
