    "## 🌟 Scenario: Content Moderation System\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You've joined a growing tech community platform that has **50,000 users** but only **3 moderators**:\n",
    "- **Sarah** manually reviews posts (6 hours/day, 200+ posts in queue)\n",
    "- **Mike** tries to help users improve content (rarely has time)\n",
    "- **Lisa** identifies harmful content (can't keep up)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Issues:**\n",
    "- Takes 5-10 minutes per post to check safety, tone, and grammar manually\n",
    "- Users don't understand why content is rejected\n",
    "- No time to enhance approved content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Build an **AI-Powered Content Moderation System** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classifies** content type (social media post / article / comment)\n",
    "2. **Analyzes** safety, tone, and grammar **in parallel**\n",
    "3. **Scores** and decides: approve or reject\n",
    "4. **Enhances** approved content automatically\n",
    "5. **Provides feedback** to users\n",

    "**Expected Impact:** Reduce moderation time from 5-10 minutes to 30 seconds per post!\n",
